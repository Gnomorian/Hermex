# Hermex
Open Source Video chat, IRC and screenshare application

Hermex is intended as a discord alternative. I was anoyed with how often the camera and screenshare stopped working so started working on an my own version. It should do the following:
* use less memory
* use less processing power
* Be more reliable with sharing your screen (particularly audio)
* Allow users to host their owm servers

What it looks like at the moment:
